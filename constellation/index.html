we've been doing a lot of work over the last year, all aimed at making it easier for you to weave together many large graphs and end up with exactly the data you need, in exactly the shape you need it. after all, that's the promise of graphql.

first, let's look at the state of graphql and federation today.

  these are two views of more or less the same data—although our little floating space graph has a bit of information pruned out for simplicity.

  i started with the graph because... well, because it looks really cool, to be honest. but also! because i want to move away from the syntax a little bit and invite you to start thinking about graphs *as graphs*, and specifically, as structures we can manipulate: shift, fold, and reshape.

  [[ SHAKE A NODE ]]

  in this space, types are places you can *be*. fields are journeys—ways you can *move* from place to place. resolvers teach us *how to take a journey*.

  the resolvers know how to take us to the data

  if we didn't have graphql, we would still be able to expose this data. we'd just have to come up with our own interface to request it.

  graphql gives us a common language for expressing the shape of our data. yes, that makes accessing the data easier. but it's also more than that. a colleague of mine once said: "every problem in computer science can be solved with another layer of indirection".

  i probably shouldn't say this at a graphql summit, while working for the graphql people, but graphql is ultimately kindof a stupid technology. i mean that in the most loving way possible! it's beautifully stupid, beautifully simple. it's basically describing all your data as a big typed JSON object. anyone could have designed it, and in fact, everyone did! and everyone did it differently.
  
  but a common language is a powerful thing. with a common language, we can connect disparate clusters of concepts and data. the common language creates a new space, a data layer that holds the graph of everything.

  the federated graph joins our other two graphs. you can think of it as a projection of both of them. and it's quite a faithful one—it contains all the types and fields from all our services, with the same types, names, arguments, and so on. you can see that it even more or less has the same shape

  it also has links to the source graphs. it knows where all these types and fields are *from* and how to get from one graph to another.

  that's federation as it stands today. it's is already incredibly powerful. lots of organizations are already getting tremendous benefit from it.
  
  <!-- netflix has this huge federated graph, which surprised me until i thought about how much data they have. and every time we talk to them they're doing some new, cool thing with it because of federation. -->

  federation effectively gives us the "reduce" part of "map/reduce", but for the structure of our data itself. as with mapreduce, this lets you parallelize work—only in this case, the work is *growing the graph*. with federation, you can have multiple teams each working on growing the graph—it grows in parallel.

  which means, your graph can explode.

  this is powerful, but it can also be a lot! the amount of accessible data in your organization and frankly in the world is enough to make anyone's brain start dropping frames just like my computer.
  
  massive graphs create new, massive problems. you still have one graph to reason about, but now it's made of tens or hundreds of subgraphs, each likely maintained by a separate team. you have to make sure they fit together, make sure nobody steps on anyone else's toes.
  
  there are also some use cases that federation doesn't handle yet. when we federate graphs today, we end up with a federated graph that looks a lot like our subgraphs. same names, same types, same fields. but what if we want to change that? what if we want more flexibility in how we merge our graphs together?

  some of you might remember schema stitching—some of you might *still be using* schema stitching. schema stitching was kindof a precursor to federation: a more bare-metal way of merging subgraphs together. with schema stitching, you could really do whatever you wanted to the subgraphs, pruning and reshaping fields, changing types. but schema stitching was very ad-hoc—literally, you write some javascript that manipulates the schema ASTs more or less directly. that's extremely flexible, but also quite hard to reason about. with federation, we can and do run validations on the composed graph. schema stitching doesn't really allow for that, because outside of the requirement that it be a valid graphql schema, we really have no way of knowing if the stitched schema is correct.

  what if we could have both? the verifiability of federation with the flexibility of schema stitching?

  everything we're talking about today will work with your current clients and your current federated services. but they'll also work with services that aren't currently federated. federation does require a bit of work: you have to declare keys and define entity resolvers. and you may still want to do this, even in the future! but you won't have to. constellation gives us tools to federate services that have not implemented federation! it lets us weave together graphs that have no idea they're in a federation at all.

  to federate this service properly, we would probably merge the types into a single User type, defining email as a key. this would let us query everything together.

  but it's still not ideal.
  
  thing one: we've arbitrarily decided that agitprop should "own" the User type, and obscura should extend it. we could have decided it the other way, it doesn't matter. ideally, we'd like to avoid having to make decisions that don't matter, especially around a concept with emotional charge like "ownership".
  
  this change also means that obscura's `Query.member` now returns type User, which is... interesting. we could change it, but that means going through a whole breaking changes dance: adding new fields, @deprecating the old ones, and then, once the old fields aren't queried anymore, removing them. frankly, it doesn't really seem worth it.

  we had to change our services, adding `__entities` resolvers in the obscura service. those resolvers will basically do the same thing as resolvers we already have, so it's a bit frustrating that we have to define them at all.
  
  this example is synthetic, but these are not uncommon problems! this is basically what you run into whenever you're trying to link two graphs which have grown independently—they're going to have some overlap, so the unified schema will have some... odor to it. under federation today, fixing that odor requires changing the existing services.

  but constellation is going to give us some tools to improve the situation.

  before we dive in, i want to bracket this: nothing we're about to see is set in stone. everything is a draft! this is the direction we're thinking of going, and its shape is almost certainly going to change by the time we get there. so if you have thoughts, good or bad, please share them with us along the way!

  via.

  this argument tells the gateway what query to run to resolve an entity from this key. the query planner is smart about the types here—if the field takes an array of keys and returns an array of users, it'll call it with a batch of entities. if it doesn't, it'll generate multiple query branches.

  so now we don't have to write `__entities`. we still *can*, resolving via __entities is still the default, but we don't have to. which means we don't need to make any code changes to our services.

  ah, except we did change the names of the Member type to User. drat.

  to address that, we're going to do something new: we're going to write a schema for *the federated service itself*

  this makes some sense, right? a federated graph is, after all, a *whole new graph*. so we should be able to write a schema for it. in federation today, that schema is generated purely by composing our subgraph schemas. constellation gives us more control.

  this is just graphql! we've introduced a new directive, @include, which includes other schemas into this one.

  the graph argument lets us specify what subgraphs to include. in its simplest form, it just takes the name of a subgraph—that's what we're doing with agitprop. but we can also use query-like syntax to select and in this case rename types from the schema, giving us control over what types are included and how.
  
  then we can extend the joined user type with keys for each subgraph. this part isn't really new, though we are using the new via argument.

  with this joined schema, we don't have to change the underlying services at all! instead, we're telling the compiler exactly how we want our graphs to be composed

  we can still do more. right now, our graph is pretty spare.

  in particular, the notes we can take on readings have a position, but no text, so the frontend has to go query the text from project gutenberg independently.
  
  we can fix this! if project gutenberg has a graphql api, we can add it to our service list and federate against it. as far as the gateway is concerned, it's just another service.
  
  and then, we can do this:

<pre id="unifiedGutenberg">
<code class="graphql">
# unified.gql

schema
  @include(graph: "agitprop")
  @include(graph: "obscura {
    Query
    User: Member
    Film
    Screening
    Rating
  }") {}

extend type User
  @key(graph: "agitprop", fields: "email", via: "user(email)")
  @key(graph: "obscura", fields: "email", via: "member(email)")

extend type Reading {
  author: Author @external
  title: String @external
  text: String
    @from(query: "
      gutenberg::search(
        author: author.name,
        title: title).nodes.0.text")
}
</code>
</pre>

<script>When(buildInRange(feat, {
  order: Infinity
})).start(function () {
  return Graph.graphData(agitpropAndObscura);
});
When(buildInRange(feat, {
  order: Infinity
})).withDuration(3[sec]).at(orbit());</script>

<build-note id="featUnifiedGutenberg">
what we've done here is introduce a new directive—the @from directive, which says, "in order to resolve this field, run this other query." now we have the text of our readings!

the query we specify has a couple of new pieces of syntax. this new query syntax isn't exposed to clients, but it's pretty important to have here, in the data layer.

the new pieces are graph identifiers and dotted paths. here, the graph identifier tells us to query the gutenberg subgraph, which we've configured we need the dotted paths to dig into the search results and lift the text of the first one up so it can be its own string field. keeping with the spirit of graphql, dot paths here act like optional chains—if any step is nullable, the whole thing is nullable

this turns out to be pretty powerful, especially when you start thinking about larger graphs.

there's a lot of power here, but the DX is a bit lacking. we're doing a lot of work inside string arguments to directives, which isn't super great. what if... what if we could write this instead?

  we call this a star schema. this is a proper superset of graphql.

  instead of @include directives, we've introduced a *type spread* operator. this works a lot like the existing fragment spread operator, but instead of adding selections to a query, we're adding types into our schema. you'll also be able to use the syntax to spread the fields of one type into another.

  the other new piece of syntax on display here is the assignment operator. here, we're assigning the text field to a query. that query can use the extended query syntax we saw earlier to select the gutenberg graph, and dig out the text of the first search result.

  right now, you might be thinking, "oh, cool!" or you might be thinking: "ashi! you promised back compatibility! you can't go adding features to the language all willy-nilly" maybe both! we contain multitudes!

  thing is: we're not adding this to graphql. and this *is* back compatible. all this new syntax compiles down to graphql. everything on the left is syntactic sugar for what we had earlier:

  it's just a bit cleaner, shorter, easier to write.

  this is all possible because we're introducing a compile step. or rather, we're making the existing compile step—which happens in the gateway—more explicit, and more powerful, and something you are able to run yourself, locally.

  to be clear: we're not completely set on this syntax—though it does *feel* rather nice, doesn't it? part of why we're sharing this early work is to get some feedback.

  and the other reason is to get you excited. this is really cool! i mean, can you imagine the process you'd have to go through to write a service that does something like this today? here, with really just a few extensions to federation, we're able to do it without writing any resolvers, without pushing any binaries. these tools let us express joins and delegation and a whole host of data *flow* concepts within the data layer, where they can be statically analyzed, planned, and validated.
  
  that's exciting now, and it's going to be vital in the future
</build-note>

<build-note id="future">
  as the space of data that we're working with continues to grow in size and complexity, these are the kinds of tools we'll need to wrangle, project, and reshape those graphs.

  remember the semantic web? this idea that we'd create a substrate of machine-readable data on the web? and then it would be easy for everyone from hobbyists to partner organizations to navigate this massive space of information we're constantly creating and cataloguing? *this* is the semantic web. and this work is building a language for accessing and manipulating it. we're building new ways to find patterns in the sky.

  like i said before, these are ~forward looking statements which may contain inaccuracies~. or: this is prophecy. which means it's squishy, because that is the nature of the future. which means, if you're excited by any of this, you can help shape it. the best way to start is to get into federation now, so you can be involved in this next phase of development.
  
  apollo has been community driven from the beginning. we don't want to do this alone. we can't really do this alone. we can write the tools, but will we write the right tools? we can build a future, but will it be a future for all of us? that's the question in... a lot of areas of society right now, and also here.

  i'm excited by this work because... well, because i'm profoundly a nerd. but also because we're working to make the space of data—the graph of everything, this vast sea of everything known to computers—more intelligible. more accessible. we are creating tools which are easier to hold. we are opening possibilities. we are, hopefully, inviting more people into this world. and i think whatever the challenges, expanding the space of freedom is a fundamental good.

  so come with us. we're headed to the stars.
